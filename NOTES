Input format:

* Tensor labels: i[1-9][0-9]+ are intermediates. All else are inputs ([txvf][0-9]+), including i0

* Sum() and P() can be removed

* For inputs, irrep is in the suffix

* Contraction labeling: parts
  - File name (t1_, t2_, t3_, ..)
  - At the top-level (indent 0), all contractions are labeled 1_, 2_, ..
  - Within a level (e.g., t2_3), all contractions at the immediate enclosed level are labeled 1_, 2_,..
  - Intermediate tensor name: name of contraction that first defines it (always at the top (_1) of the list of contractions that define it)

* Replace use of intermediate with their unique name/labels

* Array creation: as late as possible
* Array destruction: as early as possible


Clarifications:

* Additions of tensors with different irreps
