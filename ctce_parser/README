Required
--------
Flex (get it from http://flex.sourceforge.net/ or https://github.com/westes/flex)

visitor.h and visitor.c are used only for debugging purposes. That is once the AST is constructed
after parsing, visitor traverses the AST, prints back the parsed input to the a file output.txt - which 
can be compared to the input file provided to check for any parsing issues.

To test:

Run ./ctce_test transform_input/generated/ccsd_t1.eq.lvl (use any .lvl file)

Other Notes:
------------
The following build warning(s) can be safely ignored.

parser.c:109:42: warning: unused variable ‘root’ [-Wunused-variable]
 #define ParseARG_FETCH  TranslationUnit* root  = yypParser->root 
                                          ^
parser.c:531:3: note: in expansion of macro ‘ParseARG_FETCH’
   ParseARG_FETCH;
