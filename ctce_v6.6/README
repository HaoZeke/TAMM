How to Patch cTCE to NWChem-6.6
===============================

1.	Download and install NWChem-6.6 code 

2. 	Copy the contents of the folder tce in the folder $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/tce
		Here:
		a) a new folder 'ctce-paiwei' is copied to $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/tce. 
		b) file ccsd_t.F is patched in folder $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/tce/ccsd_t
		c) files ccsd_t1.F and ccsd_t2.F are patched in  folder $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/tce/ccsd
		d) compile these modified files

3.	In folder $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src modify GNUmakefile to include following

		$(PURIFY) $(LINK.f) -o $(BINDIR)/$(NWBINNAME) nwchem.o stubs.o -lnwctask \ 
		 -L./tce/ctce-paiwei/src $(LIBS) -lstdc++

		Sample GNUmakefile provided here.

4. 	Modifications to file $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/config/NWCHEM_CONFIG to include
		-lctce -lvib -lvscf

		Sample NWCHEM_CONFIG file provided here.

5.	Now build the library lctce by running the GNUmakefile in folder
		$(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/tce/ctce-paiwei/src

6.	Link nwchem from folder $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src


Troubleshooting
===============

1.  Make sure NWCHEM_TOP path is set properly. 
2.  Make sure 'module purge' and 'module load nwchem' on Chinook for proper environmental setting.
3.  Make sure the path to ctce library folder.
