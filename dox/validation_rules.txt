Validation for Tensor Declaration:

0- if there is dependent label, the number of labels in parenthesis should be equal to the number of dependent index spaces 
1- each label name in a tensor construction should be unique
2- every label used as a dependent label should be in the tensor construction
3- should has a topological order for labels where all dependent labels (labels within parenthesis) comes before
