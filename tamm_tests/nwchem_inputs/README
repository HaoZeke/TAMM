IP (naphthalene_ccpvdz_ip.nw)  ->  we have 4 possibilities for the CCSD/IP-EOMCCSD driver (CCSD-new->IP-EOMCCSD-old or CCSD-old->IP-EMCCSD etc.)
EA (naphthalene_ccpvdz_ea.nw) -> same story
Linear response (naphthalene_ccpvdz_lr.nw) : Only CCSD and Lambda-CCSD can be switched between old and new version. All linear-response routines use old TCE implementations.
EOMCC (naphthalene_ccpvdz_eomcc.nw): Only CCSD can be switched between old and new implementations. EOMCCSD uses old TCE implementation. 


shell-mixed-18.5_631G.nw – input for smaller ferrocene run (around 520 basis set functions)
 
shell-mixed-18.5-combined_basis.nw – larger basis set for ferrocene (around 1200 basis functions)
 
I have also attached outputs. For larger basis there are two outputs – one with CCSD and one with IP-EOMCCSD.
Large calc. should be  performed in two or three steps:
1.)    Integrals – saving integrals
2.)    Reading  integrals – performing CCSD – saving CCSD ampitudes
3.)    Reading integrals & amplitudes – performing IP-EOMCCSD calculations


For ferrocene (small basis set) shell-mixed-18.5-631G (no symmetry used)
O=125
V=355
 
For ferrocene (large basis set) shell-mixed-18.5_combined_basis (no symmetry used)
O=1014
V=125
 
For C60 (high symmetry used)
O=1070
V=120
